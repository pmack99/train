Week 7 homework assignment:

Train Schedule Database

I created a Firebase backed train schedule application

I used a newframework, Materialize with HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render the schedule on the web page.
I used Firebase to host a globally available set of data that is retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide information about the newly imported trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.
